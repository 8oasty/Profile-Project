                <h2 class="company-name"> Photography </h2>
                <p>
                        People start doing photography (versus taking snaps or selfies) for many reasons. It might be a major life event coming up – new baby, wedding, special birthday – or that overseas trip saved up for over many years. It might be that the capabilities of your phone frustrate you enough to want to get real about photography. However it happens, suddenly you find yourself with an empty bank account and some form of camera gear that you now need to figure out how and where and maybe even, why to use it.

                <p>
                        When people used to ask me what my hobbies were, the very first thing that would come to mind was “Travel!”…  It always seemed like the easy answer; probably because travel is amazing, desirable, Instagram-able, and the thing that everyone strived for in life.

                    <p>
                            This watching movie as a hobby thing started during your first day at a college or school or tuition, where the professor/teacher for introduction makes each and every one stand up and say their name and from where they are and stuff and tell you to speak about yourself and what are the hobbies. Believe me the professor has no interest in learning about your hobbies at all, its just he/she wants make a impression among the students that he/she is cool enough to respect your hobbies.
